========================================================================
DNS 
- Domain Name System
- It is a phonebook of the internet
- It translates human-readable domain names into IP addressess that computers use to identify each other on the network.
- Accessing information online through domain names,
- Example: www.<Name>.com
- Domain Name System (DNS) protocol is the process of searching for specific websites through web browsers.

========================================================================
How internet is working
- Computers connect to each other and to the Internet either by wired or wireless. Say, Wifi.
- Data sent over the Internet is translated into pulses of light/electricity, also called "bits".
- Then  "bits" interpreted by the receiving computer.
- Example: via wires, cables, radio waves & other types of networking infrastructure.
- It works by using a packet routing network that follows Internet Protocol (IP) and Transport Control Protocol (TCP).
- TCP and IP work together to ensure that data transmission across the internet is consistent and reliable, no matter which device you're using or where you're using it.

========================================================================
Importance of DNS
- DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.
- It makes it much easier for humans to work with network components and find the resources they need, as it: 
- Relates names and IPs, making it easier to find resources. 
	Makes URLs work for websites. 
	Makes email addresses work.
- Human Usability, Load Distribution, Redundancy and Reliability, Security
- Applications: Web Browsing, Email Services, Load Balancing, Content Delivery Networks(CDNs)
========================================================================

Time Series Database
- A time series database (TSDB) is optimized for storing and querying time-stamped data, which is crucial for applications that track changes over time.
- Example: Monitoring Systems, IoT Applications, Financial Data, Scientific Research.
- A time series database (TSDB) is a database optimized for time-stamped or time series data.
- Time series data are simply measurements or events that are tracked, monitored, downsampled, and aggregated over time. 
- A TSDB is optimized for measuring change over time. 
- Properties that make time series data very different than other data workloads are data lifecycle management, summarization, and large range scans of many records.

========================================================================
Why we are not using MySQL and MongoDB ?
- They are difficult to scale
- Efficiency: TSDBs are optimized for time-stamped data and can handle the high write loads and query requirements efficiently.
- Compression: TSDBs often provide better compression algorithms tailored to time series data, reducing storage costs.
- Query Performance: TSDBs offer specialized query capabilities for time-based data, which can be significantly faster than general-purpose databases.
- Retention Policies: TSDBs typically have built-in support for data retention policies, automatically archiving or deleting old data.
